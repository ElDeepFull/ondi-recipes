    <h1>Recipes Pork Tenderloin</h1>
    <h2>Balsamic Braised Pork Tenderloins with Fresh Figs</h2>
    <p>
        Use fresh figs to add some sweetness to these balsamic braised pork tenderloins. <br>
        Bonus: There is no added sugar! The dish starts on the stove top and finishes in the oven, <br> 
        freeing you up for other tasks. We like this dish with roasted potatoes that let the oven do double duty. <br>
        A simple green salad completes the meal.

    <p><em>Cook Time: </em>45 mins</p>
    <p><em>Total Time: </em>1 hr</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup good-quality balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step2</h3>
    <p>Pat tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.</p>
    <h3>Step3</h3>
    <p> Pour oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-heat until oil shimmers. <br>
        Carefully place seasoned tenderloins
        into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes total.
    </p>
    <h3>Step4</h3>
    <p> Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar. <br>
         When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced rosemary over everthing.
    </p>
    <h3>Step5</h3>
    <p> Cover, place in the preheated oven and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. <br>
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
    </p>
    <h3>Step6</h3>
    <p> Using tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving platter. <br>
        With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet and
        place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.
    </p>
    <h3>Step7</h3>
    <p> Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat. <br>
        Bring pan juices to a boil and allow to reduce to about 3/4 cup, 10
        to 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step8</h3>
    <p>Slice tenderloins, drizzle reduced liquid over the meat, and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs, if desired.</p>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
